          As a fashion designer, I am driven by the intersection of minimalist aesthetics and innovative textiles. My
          work explores the balance between form and function, creating pieces that are both visually striking and
          practical for everyday wear.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 dark:text-gray-300">
          Drawing inspiration from architectural structures, natural landscapes, and cultural movements, I strive to
          create collections that tell a cohesive story while allowing each piece to stand on its own. My design
          philosophy centers on sustainability and ethical production, using responsibly sourced materials and working
          with manufacturers who prioritize fair labor practices.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-300">
          With a background in textile development and pattern making, I bring a technical understanding to my creative
          process. This allows me to push boundaries while maintaining a commitment to quality craftsmanship and
          attention to detail.
